    "three points *x* = ±1, 0.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "One might think that better convergence properties may be obtained by\n",

    "  \n",

    "approximation *p*<sub>*n*</sub><sup> \\* </sup>(*x*) converges to\n",
    "*f*(*x*) uniformly (due to [Weierstrass approximation\n",

    "only to show that each *p*<sub>*n*</sub><sup> \\* </sup>(*x*) may be\n",
